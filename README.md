A collection of projects showcasing my experience in programming for prospective employers.

## C_HCS12

## C_HCS12_RangeFinder
C program for a RangeFinder robot built on top of a HCS12 MCU. The device features LIDAR and IMU placed atop a pan and tilt unit operated by two servos. The robot outputs serial data to a computer which is then able to live plot the data when the native front end is also run.
